code description

run_encoding_decoding.m is a wrapper that shows how you can use the encoding and decoding matlab code. The data is first loaded and than encoding is applied with linear regression. Next, decoding is applied in four different ways: unimodal decoding, multimodal decoding, multimodal decoding with semantic gating, unsupervised multimodal decoding.

Please refer to the following articles when using this code:
