    'A common use of this PlugIn is for an F test for a set of contrasts. For each subject, we have k contrasts jointly expressing some effect of interest.  Under the null hypothesis we assume that the data for each subject is unpeturbed by multiplication by -1.  That is, under the null hypothesis the multivariate measurements are all mean zero and symmetrically distributed.  We assume exchangeability between subjects (just as we usually assume independent subjects) but *do* *not* assume that the k values for each subject are independent.',...

Intuitively, each subject can be assigned to +1 or -1, so we should have 2^nSubj possible permutations. However, since we are doing an F test and all +1''s and all -1''s would give us the same F statistic. To avoid the redundance, therefore we explicitly assign the first subject to +1 group.',...
