JOHNSON CURVE TOOLBOX FOR MATLAB
by David L. Jones, PhD
djones14@mail.usf.edu

This TOOLBOX is a set of MATLAB functions for working with the Johnson system of distributions to analyze non-normal, univariate data sets. Portions of it are based on my port of the AS 99 (Hill et al., 1976) and AS 100 (Hill, 1976) FORTRAN-66 code. I am releasing the TOOLBOX to the public, under the BSD 2-clause license, to encourage the sharing of code, prevent duplication of effort, and allow greater access to the AS-99 and AS-100 algorithms.

If you use this TOOLBOX to produce a report or publication, PLEASE include the citation listed below to help justify maintenance and further development of the code. I'd also appreciate bug reports and suggestions for improvements. While I've made every attempt to write code that provides accurate and precise results, the functions in this TOOLBOX are provided as is, with no guarantees.

NOTES:
Most functions have detailed documentation and references added as text comments at the beginning of each file. To view this information, load an M-file into the Matlab editor. Check out the 'examples' folder located within the main folder to see demonstrations of how to use the functions. The best way to use an example M-file is to load one in the Matlab Editor and interactively follow the demonstration by selecting one or a few line(s) of code and hitting SHIFT-F7 on the MAC (or F9 on the PC) to evaluate it in the Matlab Command window, rather than running the entire M-file.

UPDATES:
The latest version of these functions are available at: http://www.marine.usf.edu/user/djones/.
