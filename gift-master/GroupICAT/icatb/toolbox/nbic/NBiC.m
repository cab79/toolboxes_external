%%
% N-BiC is a biclustering method for simultaneously clustering two interacting variables
% It clusters a 2D matrix where each dimension represents a variable. Each variable has a set of examples 
% Variables could be subjects, neuro components
% It requires a sorting method to build the set of instancs for all given examples of the variable 
% If we have 'n' components
% After sorting, each component becomes a susbet of subjects 
% Prerequisite for the N-Bic method: Why sorting? 
% Since we use intersection for the merging or composing the biclusters,
% We need to represent variables from one dimension as a function (subset) of variables from other dimension 
% We sort the components as a subset of subejects based on a predefiend heuristic
% 'Search_BIC' is used to explore the biclusters for a given set of variables 
% The validator is integrated with the 'Search_BIC' subroutine
% A bicluster is a two-dimensional submatrix
% Input:
% x_size: minimum number fo rows (instances in x dimension) #components in a  biclusters
% y_size: minimum number fo cols (instances in y dimension) #subjects in a  biclusters
% tolerance: Allowed percentage of overlap between two biclusters 
% variable_Ids: Ids of sorted variables under consideration. If you want to run the analysis on 
% all the features, then it would just be 1:number of features. 
% But if we want to skip some features from the analysis, this option will provide us the flexibility   
% reps = no of expected repititions. The input ids would be randomly permutated 'reps' number of times  
% raw_data_matrix: the raw data
% Output:
% a list of biclusters
